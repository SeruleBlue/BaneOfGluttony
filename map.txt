Welcome to the Savanna.	Sa -  - The plains finally start to succumb to the arid environment of the desert, thining the grassland to sparse patches of green. Meanwhile, the nearby river fills the deep underground with nutrients, which only the strongest of trees can thrive on. The result is the most peculiar mix of desert and forest.
