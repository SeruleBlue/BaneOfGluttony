[b][u]Disclaimer:[/u][/b] This is a debug release. The normal release version that will be posted on FA is identical, save for the removal of the debug console. The purpose of this is to fix any potential bugs (it’s probably riddled with bugs I’m not aware of) that may pop up during play-testing. This post will be updated as relatively minor additions/changes/fixes are made, so keep an eye out for updates. Again, mind that all content, numbers, text, etc. are all subject to change and balance, so take everything with a grain of salt.

Hello everyone! It’s that time again. Time for another update to BoG! Again it has a lot of changes under the hood, but there is still some new content for you guys to sink your teeth into!

We have introduced:

[ul type="disc"][li]Quest/Events
[ul type="square"]
[li]The Blade &amp; Belly quest is now available in the entire lower half of Staphshire.[/li]
[li]The bread thief event has been moved to the southwest corner of Stapshire.[/li]
[li]An event made by our very own @aaron! Won’t spoil it here, but it's a ways south of town. Have fun with it![/li][/ul][/li]
[li]Combat
[ul type="square"]
[li]Big fixes! Just a lot under the hood.[/li]
[li]Bandits and giant moles have been added as enemies![/li][/ul][/li]
[li]Map
[ul type="square"]
[li]Our 100x100 map has finally been added. [b]NOTE: Given the enormous size (10000 cells) the game will need a moment or two to load and parse all the information in the map.[/b][/li]
[li]We know it’s a bit difficult to navigate without a visual map, so we apologize for that. We're still waiting to get a new one drawn up! In the meantime, feel free to [a href="https://github.com/BaneOfGluttony/BaneOfGluttony/releases/download/v0.8.1/BoGmap.xlsx"]click here[/a] to download an Excel spreadsheet to use as a map.[/li]
[li]For now you should be limited to the central area, and there isn't much very far outside of town, but it's all there![/li][/ul][/li]

Again, if you find any bugs, please copy whatever nonsense that gets printed in the debug console (if anything is printed at all) and either post a reply here or PM me with as much information about the bug’s circumstances as possible so the code monkey can fix it! Preferably, post it as a reply here so other people can see if a particular bug has already been reported.

We hope you continue to enjoy this game and are as excited as we are moving forward!

[a href="https://github.com/BaneOfGluttony/BaneOfGluttony/releases/download/v0.8.1/BaneOfGluttony.v0.8.1.debug.swf"][font size="6"][b]Download v0.8 here![/b][/font][/a]

To run it, all you have to do it download it and drag it onto an open browser window. 

And with that, I hope you enjoy!

Happy hunting![/ul]

[b][i]v0.8.1[/i][/b]
Loading the game has been massively optimized. Huge thanks to [a href="http://www.furaffinity.net/user/serule"]Serule[/a] for single-handedly fixing that for me! This has reduced load times by an order of magnitude, depending on the system. As a result, the game should no longer freeze the entire tab/browser while trying to start.

This was caused by me originally telling the game to set up all 10,000 tiles on the map from a 10,000 line file from the very start. Horribly inefficient, I know, but I hadn't considered any other way at the time. Because that actually has nothing to do with loading any assets or anything, there is very little that can be done about that to ease what appears to be the game "loading" when it's actually just running a ton of CPU cycles. Instead, the game now only sets up the small section of the map you start in and prepares the rest of the map dynamically as you approach the edges of what currently exists in the map. This means that the game will continue "loading" the map as you play as needed, but you should only barely notice a pause, if at all, when it needs to load more of the map.

[b][i]v0.8.2[/i][/b]

[ul type="disc"][li]World/map loading has been further optimized thanks to [a href="http://www.furaffinity.net/user/serule"]Serule[/a]
[ul type="square"]
[li]Zones will only load near the player, 'leading' the player based on the most recent direction travelled in[/li]
[li]Optimization of 100% to over 5000% (time reduced down to <0.1s, from 0.1s to over 0.5s)[/li][/ul][/li]
[li]Save files have been fixed to work with quests (hopefully) and have been reenabled[/li]
[li]Added in-game time/clock[/li]
[li]Added player metabolism which affects fat conversion[/li]
[li]Added resting to overworld
[ul type="square"]
[li]Resting is currently fixed to one hour intervals[/li]
[li]Resting restores 10% of your max health per hour[/li]
[li]Resting digests a large portion of what's in your stomach, converting it into fat at a slightly higher rate than if you were traveling
[ul type="circle"]
[li]Note that since resting takes an entire hour, it will look like it digests way more than it would if you were traveling because traveling only takes a few mintues[/li][/ul][/li]
[li]If you're resting on a space with potential enemy or event encounters, you can still be interrupted and trigger an encounter while resting, albeit at a significantly reduced probability[/li]
[li]Resting causes a slight decrease in metabolism (accordingly, moving causes a slight increase in metabolism)[/li][/ul][/li]
[li]Added waiting to combat to just skip your turn[/li]
[li]Added a few digestive items to the apothecary that instantly digest a percentage of your stomach capacity at a significantly increased fat conversion rate than even resting[/li][/ul]
