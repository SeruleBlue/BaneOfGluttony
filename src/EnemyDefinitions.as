A guttural hiss sounds from within the creature, spewing out bits and pieces of itself as it engages you.",

With your entire body encased in the slime's mysterious goo, you simply allow the creature to seep through your lips before suddenly realizing it's suffocating you. As you try to gasp for air, a sudden influx of the slime's fruity juices rush into your body and down your throat like a whirlpool. Every labored, oxygen-starved gulp you take makes your throat bulge visibly with the substance before flushing into your stomach, causing it to steadily swell bigger and bigger before your eyes. Before you know it though, you find yourself panting for breath with the slime nowhere to be found, the only evidence of its existence now sloshing and residing in your quivering gut.",
